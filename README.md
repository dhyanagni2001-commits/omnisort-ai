# OmniSort AI

An AI-powered file organizer that watches multiple folders simultaneously and sorts every file into the right place — automatically. Define custom folders for your own categories (Bank, Tax, Work, ML Notes). Built privacy-first: sensitive files are detected locally and never sent to an external API.

---

## Privacy-first design

> Medical records, tax documents, and contracts may contain SSNs, email addresses, or phone numbers. OmniSort detects PII **before** any LLM call — including in the filename itself. If a file contains sensitive data, it is classified entirely on-device and the content never leaves your machine.

```
Check filename for PII
     │
     ▼
Extract text
     │
     ▼
Check content for PII (on-device, regex)
     │
     ├── PII found (filename OR content) ──► Sensitive/   ← LLM never called
     │
     └── No PII ──► custom rules ──► keyword NLP ──► LLM fallback (only if needed)
```

This is a hard guarantee, not a configuration option. The PII gate runs synchronously before any network call is attempted.

---

## What it does

Drop a file into any watched folder (`~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, or any custom path). Within seconds OmniSort:

1. Waits until the file is fully written (not still downloading)
2. **Checks the filename for PII** — catches `john_SSN_123456789.pdf` before it's even opened
3. Extracts text — OCR for images, PDF parser for PDFs, **OCR fallback for scanned PDFs**
4. **Checks content for PII** — emails, phone numbers, SSNs detected on-device
5. **Runs custom rules** — your own keyword-to-folder mappings, free, no API call
6. Classifies the file — keyword NLP, then GPT-4o-mini only if no rule matched and no PII
7. Checks for duplicates — SHA-256 hash with per-hash lock preventing concurrent misses
8. Moves the file — DB write only happens after the move succeeds
9. Logs to SQLite and pushes a live WebSocket event to the dashboard

├── Duplicates/       ← same SHA-256 as a previously seen file
├── Other/
│
│   ── custom folders (created automatically from your rules) ──
├── Bank/             ← matches "bank statement", "HDFC", "transaction history"
├── Tax/              ← matches "form 16", "income tax", "assessment year"
├── Work/             ← matches "standup", "sprint", "quarterly review"
└── Health/           ← matches "prescription", "blood report", "diagnosis"
```

Routing priority: **Sensitive > Duplicate > Custom Rule > NLP/LLM Category**

---

## Custom rules

Define your own folder → keyword mappings in `configs/settings.yaml`. No code change needed — edit the file and restart.

```yaml
custom_rules:
  - folder: Bank
    keywords: ["bank statement", "account number", "transaction history", "HDFC", "ICICI", "SBI"]

  - folder: Tax
    keywords: ["form 16", "itr", "income tax", "pan card", "assessment year", "tds certificate"]

  - folder: ML Notes
    keywords: ["neural network", "gradient descent", "backpropagation", "loss function", "epoch"]

  - folder: Client XYZ
    keywords: ["XYZ Corp", "project apollo", "statement of work"]
```

Rules match against **both the filename and the extracted text**. The first matching rule wins. Folders are created automatically if they don't exist.

**Priority over built-in categories** — if a rule matches, NLP and the LLM are skipped entirely. Custom rules cost nothing.

**PII always wins** — a bank statement containing an SSN goes to `Sensitive/`, not `Bank/`.

## Classification logic

### Images

1. Filename contains `screenshot`, `screen_`, `capture`, `snip` → **Screenshots**
2. Resolution matches a known screen dimension (720p / 1080p / 4K / iPad) → **Screenshots**
3. Everything else → **Photos**

### Documents (PDF / DOCX / TXT / CSV / MD)

**Stage 0 — Filename PII gate (runs before file is opened)**

Filename scanned for email, phone, SSN. A file named `john_SSN_123456789.pdf` goes to `Sensitive/` immediately — file is never read.

**Stage 1 — Content PII gate (on-device, before NLP/LLM)**

Extracted text scanned for the same patterns. Match → `Sensitive/`, `is_sensitive = 1`, no further network calls.

**Stage 1a — Scanned PDF OCR fallback**

If PyPDF2 returns empty text (image-only PDF), PyMuPDF renders the first page at 150 DPI and pytesseract extracts text. Scanned medical reports, tax forms, and contracts are no longer silently dropped into `Documents/`.

**Stage 2 — Custom rules (on-device, zero latency, zero cost)**

User-defined keyword mappings from `settings.yaml` are checked against filename + content. First match wins → file goes to the custom folder, NLP and LLM are skipped entirely.

**Stage 3 — Keyword NLP (on-device, zero latency)**

| Keywords | Category |
|---|---|
| `invoice`, `bill`, `receipt`, `total amount`, `due date` | Invoices |
| `resume`, `curriculum vitae`, `work experience`, `references` | Resumes |
| `contract`, `agreement`, `terms and conditions`, `whereas` | Legal |

**Stage 4 — LLM fallback (GPT-4o-mini)**

Only reached when Stages 0–3 all passed without a match. Sends first 2 000 characters, returns one of:

`Medical` · `Financial` · `Academic` · `Documents` · `Other`

---

## Sensitive file detection

PII is checked in two places — filename first, then content.

| Pattern | Example match |
|---|---|
| Email | `john.doe@example.com` |
| Phone | `555-867-5309` |
| SSN | `123-45-6789` |

Detection runs via `re` — no model, no network, no latency. A match in either the filename or extracted text triggers the PII gate and prevents any LLM call.

---

## Duplicate detection

Every file is SHA-256 hashed (4 KB streaming chunks). To prevent a race condition where two identical files processed simultaneously both pass the duplicate check before either writes to the database, the entire sequence of **check → move → DB write** runs inside a per-hash `threading.Lock`.

The DB write is isolated in its own `try/except` — if it fails, the already-sorted file is not lost.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| File watching | `watchdog` (FSEvents on macOS) |
| Concurrency | `ThreadPoolExecutor` (max 4 workers) |
| Image classification | `Pillow` — resolution + filename heuristics |
| OCR | `pytesseract` (Tesseract 5) |
| PDF parsing | `PyPDF2` |
| Scanned PDF OCR | `PyMuPDF` — renders pages to images for pytesseract |

| Duplicate detection | SHA-256 + per-hash threading lock |
| Observability | In-process metrics singleton (`metrics.py`) |
| Database | SQLite via `sqlite3` |
| REST + WebSocket API | `FastAPI` + `uvicorn` |

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Tesseract OCR

```bash
# macOS
brew install tesseract

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

### Install Python dependencies

```bash
cd omnisort-ai
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### Install Electron dependencies

```bash
cd electron-app
npm install
```

### Set your OpenAI API key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Add to your shell profile to make it permanent:

```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

> The key is only used when a file reaches Stage 4 — non-sensitive, unmatched, ambiguous documents only.

---

## Running

### Python backend only (headless)

```bash
python -m backend.main
```

```
OmniSort AI running
Watching /Users/you/Downloads
Watching /Users/you/Desktop
Watching /Users/you/Documents
API at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Full desktop app (Electron + Python)

```bash
cd electron-app
npm start
```

Electron spawns the Python backend automatically and opens the dashboard.

---

## Dashboard

The Electron UI connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws` and shows:

- **Files Sorted** — total processed count
- **Duplicates** — files with matching SHA-256
- **Sensitive** — files containing PII
- **Live Activity** — real-time feed as files are sorted
- **File History** — scrollable table with filename, category, size, timestamp

---

## REST API

All endpoints served at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Liveness check → `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET` | `/api/stats` | Totals + per-category counts |
| `GET` | `/api/files?limit=50&offset=0` | Paginated file history |
| `GET` | `/api/metrics` | Runtime observability snapshot |
| `GET` | `/api/search?q=...&limit=10` | Semantic search over processed files |
| `WS` | `/ws` | Live event stream (JSON) |

### `/api/metrics` response

```json
{
  "files_per_min": 4,
  "total_files": 37,
  "ocr_failures": 1,
  "llm_calls": 12,
  "avg_classification_ms": 843.21,
  "avg_llm_ms": 712.50,
  "duplicates": 3,
  "duplicate_rate": 0.0811
}
```

### WebSocket event shape

```json
{
  "type": "file_processed",
  "filename": "hdfc_march.pdf",
  "category": "Bank",
  "is_duplicate": 0,
  "is_sensitive": 0
}
```

---

## Semantic search

Every processed text document gets a 384-dimensional embedding stored in SQLite (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 via `fastembed`, ONNX runtime — no PyTorch, works on Python 3.11+).

```bash
curl "localhost:8000/api/search?q=quarterly+revenue+report&limit=5"
```

Returns files ranked by cosine similarity to your query — finds the right document even when the filename is `final_FINAL_v3.pdf`. Images and binary-only files without extractable text degrade gracefully (no embedding stored, excluded from results).

Sensitive files are still searched locally — their embeddings are stored the same way since the model runs on-device.

---

## Docker

No Python install needed. Mount your watch folder and set your API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... WATCH_FOLDER=~/Downloads docker-compose up
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`. Files are sorted into a named Docker volume (`omnisort_output`). To mount the output to a local path instead, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /Users/you/OmniSort:/output
```

Build the image manually:

```bash
docker build -t omnisort-ai .
```

---

## Demo

See [DEMO.md](DEMO.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough of every feature with exact commands.

---

## AirDrop support

AirDrop writes a `.part` temp file then renames it to the final name. OmniSort catches the rename via `on_moved` (not `on_created`), skips `.part` files entirely, and processes the destination path — so AirDropped files sort correctly.

---

## Safety mechanisms

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| `fcntl` PID lock (`/tmp/omnisort.lock`) | Multiple OmniSort instances running simultaneously |
| `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)` | Thread explosion when hundreds of files land at once |
| `_processing` set + `threading.Lock` | Same file processed twice from concurrent watchdog events |
| Per-hash `threading.Lock` | Two identical files both passing duplicate check before either writes to DB |
| `_wait_for_file_ready()` | Processing a file still being written (checks size stability) |
| DB write after confirmed move | Move fails → DB never written; DB failure → file already sorted, error logged |
| `SKIP_SUFFIXES` (`.crdownload`, `.part`, `.tmp`, `.download`) | Browser temp files that never stabilise |
| Dot-file filter (`.DS_Store`, `.com.brave.*`) | macOS metadata and browser internal files |
| Output folder filter | OmniSort's own `shutil.move` re-triggering the watcher |
| PII gate on filename before file is opened | Sensitive filenames caught before content is read |
| PII gate on content before LLM call | Sensitive content never sent to an external API |

---
